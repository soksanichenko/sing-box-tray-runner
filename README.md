# sing-box-tray

A minimal Windows system tray launcher for [sing-box](https://sing-box.sagernet.org/).

## Features

- **Three proxy modes** switchable from the tray menu
  - **Off** — sing-box runs without touching system settings
  - **System Proxy** — sets Windows HTTP proxy from the sing-box config inbound
  - **TUN** — injects a TUN inbound into a temp config, requires elevation
- Tray icon reflects state: grey = stopped, green = running, red = crashed
- **Config** tray submenu — switch which sing-box config file is active, picked from a folder that can hold several (also duplicated in Settings); the submenu refreshes live if files are added or removed from the folder
- Settings window to configure paths (sing-box, wintun.dll), the config folder/active config, autostart, update options, and language
- Log viewer with live updates
- Crash detection with desktop notification
- File watcher — prompts to restart when config files change
- Autostart via Task Scheduler (`/RL HIGHEST` for TUN mode), toggleable from the tray menu (checkbox reflects actual state) or Settings
- Single instance enforced via named kernel mutex
- **Updates** tray submenu — auto-updates both the tray launcher itself and the `sing-box` binary from GitHub Releases, each with its own auto-update toggle (on by default); sing-box also has a stable/pre-release channel toggle
- First-run check — offers to download `sing-box.exe` and `wintun.dll` on startup if either is missing at its configured path
- **Languages** tray submenu — switch the UI language live, no restart, in addition to auto-detecting it from the Windows locale
- UI in English, Russian, or Ukrainian
- **About** tray menu item — shows the tray launcher and sing-box versions plus a link to the project repository

## Build requirements

Only the Go toolchain is needed, on either host platform — no C compiler, no Windows SDK. Nothing in this project uses cgo (`CGO_ENABLED=0` in the Makefile/scripts is mandatory, not just a preference: all Windows API calls go through `syscall`/`golang.org/x/sys/windows`, never cgo), so there's nothing to cross-compile besides Go itself.

- **Go** — matching or newer than the version pinned in `go.mod` (currently `1.25.9`). Since Go 1.21, the `go` directive in `go.mod` is an enforced minimum: an older toolchain on `PATH` will auto-fetch the pinned one via `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` if network access is available.
- **On Linux/macOS/WSL**: `./scripts/build.sh` cross-compiles to `build/sing_box_tray_runner.exe`.
- **On native Windows**: `scripts\build.ps1` (PowerShell) builds the same output, no `make` required.
- **`make`** is optional — only needed if you use `make build` instead of the scripts above.
- Regenerating `rsrc.syso` (only if `app.manifest` changes) needs `github.com/akavel/rsrc` — a pure-Go tool, installable and runnable on Linux too (see [Building](#building)).

## Runtime requirements

- Windows 10/11 x64
- [sing-box](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box) binary — auto-downloadable on first run if missing
- [wintun.dll](https://www.wintun.net/) — required only for TUN mode; auto-downloadable on first run if missing
- Internet access to `api.github.com`/`github.com` — required for the **Updates** feature and the first-run sing-box download; `www.wintun.net` is required for the first-run wintun.dll download. Everything else works fully offline

## Installation

1. Place `sing_box_tray_runner.exe` anywhere on disk.
2. On first launch, `tray-config.json` is created next to the executable with default values.
3. Right-click the tray icon → **Settings...** and set the paths.

## Configuration

`tray-config.json` (created automatically on first run):

```json
{
  "sing_box_path": "sing-box.exe",
  "wintun_dll_path": "wintun.dll",
  "config_dir": ".",
  "selected_config": "config.json",
  "system_proxy_inbound": "",
  "autostart": false,
  "default_mode": "system_proxy",
  "start_on_launch": false,
  "log_lines": 200,
  "language": "auto",
  "system_proxy": {
    "tag": "mixed-in",
    "listen": "127.0.0.1",
    "listen_port": 2080
  },
  "update": {
    "channel": "stable",
    "auto_update": true
  },
  "launcher_update": {
    "auto_update": true
  },
  "tun": {
    "interface_name": "singbox-tun",
    "address": ["172.19.0.1/30"],
    "mtu": 9000
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `sing_box_path` | Path to `sing-box.exe`. Relative paths are resolved from the tray exe directory. Rewritten automatically after an auto-update. |
| `wintun_dll_path` | Path to `wintun.dll`. Copied next to `sing-box.exe` on TUN start if not already present. |
| `config_dir` | Folder scanned (non-recursively) for `*.json` sing-box configs; the tray's **Config** submenu and the Settings config dropdown both list what's found here. |
| `selected_config` | File name (inside `config_dir`) of the currently active sing-box config. This file is never modified. |
| `system_proxy_inbound` | Tag of the `http` or `mixed` inbound to read the proxy address from. Leave empty to use the first one found. |
| `autostart` | Kept in sync with the "Autostart" checkbox in the tray menu and in Settings (whether the Task Scheduler entry exists); not meant to be hand-edited. |
| `default_mode` | Starting mode: `off`, `system_proxy`, or `tun`. |
| `start_on_launch` | If `true`, sing-box starts automatically when the tray app launches. |
| `log_lines` | Size of the in-memory log buffer shown in the log viewer. |
| `language` | UI language: `auto` (detect from Windows), `en`, `ru`, or `ua`. |
| `system_proxy.*` | Default `mixed` inbound injected when running in System Proxy mode and the base `config.json` has none. |
| `update.channel` | `stable` or `alpha` — which sing-box releases the updater considers. |
| `update.auto_update` | If `true`, sing-box updates install (and restart sing-box if running) automatically, no prompt. |
| `launcher_update.auto_update` | If `true`, tray launcher updates install and relaunch the app automatically, no prompt. |
| `tun.*` | TUN interface settings injected at runtime. The base `config.json` does not need a TUN section. |

### Config

`config_dir` can hold several sing-box config files side by side. The tray's **Config** submenu lists every `*.json` file found there and lets you pick which one is active; picking a different one restarts sing-box live if it's running. The same list is duplicated as a dropdown in Settings. The folder is polled every 2 seconds while the tray is running, so adding or removing files in `config_dir` refreshes the submenu automatically without needing to restart the tray.

### System Proxy mode

The tray reads `listen` and `listen_port` from the sing-box config's `http` or `mixed` inbound and sets the Windows system proxy in the registry. `system_proxy_inbound` is the inbound tag to use if there are multiple.

### TUN mode

The tray injects a `tun` inbound and a `route.auto_detect_interface: true` setting into a temporary copy of the config, then starts sing-box with that copy. The original config is untouched. Elevation is requested automatically via UAC.

The tray also prepends a route rule that sends sing-box's own process traffic via `direct`, preventing it from being re-captured by the TUN interface.

### Updates

The tray menu has an **Updates** submenu with two independent sections, both fetching releases straight from GitHub — no separate updater app:

- **sing-box-tray** (the tray launcher itself) — **Check for Updates** downloads the latest release of this project, swaps it into place, and relaunches. **Auto-update** (checkbox, also in Settings) skips the confirmation prompt on startup and does this silently — if sing-box happens to be running, it's stopped first (otherwise it would be orphaned once the old tray process exits) and not restarted automatically after the relaunch.
- **sing-box** — same idea as before: **Check for Updates**, plus **Auto-update** and **Use pre-release versions** checkboxes (also duplicated in Settings). Updates install into a tray-managed `sing-box/<version>/` folder next to the executable; `sing_box_path` is switched to point at the new version automatically, and older versions are removed. With auto-update on, a running sing-box is restarted automatically after an update; with it off, the tray only toasts that an update is available and installs on the next manual "Check for Updates" click.

Both sections check once on startup (toast-only unless auto-update is on) and on demand via their "Check for Updates" item.

### Localization

The UI (tray menu, dialogs, notifications, Settings/Log windows) is available in English, Russian, and Ukrainian. `language: "auto"` detects the language from the Windows UI locale. Switch it live — no restart — via the tray's **Languages** submenu or the language dropdown in Settings; both write the choice back to `tray-config.json`. Log output stays in English regardless of UI language.

## Building

```sh
make build          # any host with `make`
./scripts/build.sh   # Linux/macOS/WSL, no `make` required
scripts\build.ps1    # native Windows (PowerShell), no `make` required
```

The output is `build/sing_box_tray_runner.exe`. Set a `VERSION` env var (e.g. `VERSION=v1.2.3 ./scripts/build.sh`) to embed a version string the tray launcher's self-updater can compare against — this is how `release.yml` builds tagged releases; local dev builds leave it unset (`"dev"`).

The `rsrc.syso` file in the repo root embeds a Windows manifest (Common Controls v6). It is linked automatically by the Go toolchain and enables proper visual styling for the Settings and Log windows. Regenerate it if the manifest changes:

```sh
go install github.com/akavel/rsrc@latest
rsrc -manifest app.manifest -o rsrc.syso
```

## CI/CD

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — on every push/PR: `golangci-lint` (with `GOOS=windows`) plus a build matrix on `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest` to verify both `scripts/build.sh` and `scripts/build.ps1` work.
- **Release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — pushing a `v*` tag (e.g. `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`) builds the exe (with the tag embedded as its version, so the launcher's own self-updater can detect it) and publishes it as a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes.
- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — weekly PRs for Go module and GitHub Actions updates.

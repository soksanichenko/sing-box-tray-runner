//go:build windows

// Package appicon provides the shared window icon for the tray's lxn/walk
// windows (Settings, Log, About) — distinct from the tray's own state icons
// in assets/icons.go, which are only used for the systray itself.

// walk.NewIconFromFile reloads from disk per DPI, so the backing file is
// written to os.TempDir() (not a file that gets removed) to persist for
// the process lifetime, and loaded once via sync.Once since the same
// *walk.Icon can be shared across multiple windows.

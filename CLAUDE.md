# sing-box-tray — project notes for Claude

Windows-only today (see below), but a native Linux port is planned — see `docs/linux-port.md` for the agreed scope/architecture before touching anything Linux-related.

## Build

Windows-only project, cross-compiled from Linux:

```sh
make build
# or, without `make`:
./scripts/build.sh    # Linux/macOS/WSL
scripts\build.ps1     # native Windows (PowerShell)
# or manually:
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build \
  -ldflags="-H windowsgui -s -w" \
  -o build/sing_box_tray_runner.exe .
```

`scripts/build.sh`/`build.ps1` accept an optional `VERSION` env var, appended as `-ldflags -X .../internal/version.Version=$VERSION` — `release.yml` sets it from the pushed tag; unset (dev builds) leaves `version.Version` at its `"dev"` default.

`rsrc.syso` in the repo root is a pre-generated Windows resource object that embeds `app.manifest` (Common Controls v6 dependency) and `assets/icons/working.ico` (the exe's own icon, shown by Explorer/taskbar pinning — separate from any individual window's icon, see **Window icons** below). The Go toolchain links it automatically. Without the manifest, `lxn/walk` windows fail silently. Regenerate with:

```sh
~/go/bin/rsrc -manifest app.manifest -ico assets/icons/working.ico -o rsrc.syso
```

## Architecture

```
main.go               — mutex, UAC elevation for TUN, systray.Run
internal/
  tray/tray.go        — App struct: orchestrates everything, handles menu clicks
  state/state.go      — thread-safe AppState × ProxyMode state machine with subscriptions
  process/process.go  — sing-box child process: Start/Stop/watch (crash detection)
  config/config.go    — tray-config.json load/save; FindInboundAddr parses sing-box config
  tun/tun.go          — InjectTUN: builds temp config with TUN inbound injected
  proxy/proxy.go      — Windows system proxy via registry + WinInet flush
  elevation/          — IsElevated, RelaunchAsAdmin (ShellExecuteW "runas")
  autostart/          — HKCU Run key for normal autostart, Task Scheduler (schtasks.exe, CREATE_NO_WINDOW) for elevated (TUN) autostart
  logbuf/             — circular log buffer, file mirror with timestamps, subscriptions
  appicon/            — shared *walk.Icon for the lxn/walk windows (Settings/Log/About), loaded from a temp-file copy of assets.IconGrey
  logwin/             — lxn/walk log viewer window
  settings/           — lxn/walk settings window
  aboutwin/           — lxn/walk About window (version info + clickable repo link)
  watcher/            — polls os.Stat every 2s for config file changes, and the config folder's file listing for added/removed configs
  updater/            — GitHub release lookup + download/extract (sing-box) or fetch (launcher asset)
  selfupdate/         — swaps the running tray exe for a freshly downloaded one
  version/            — Version var, overridden via -ldflags at release build time
  i18n/               — UI string catalog (en/ru/ua), OS locale detection, live menu retitling
assets/
  icons.go            — embeds grey/green/red tray-state ICO files (assets/icons/*.ico) via go:embed
  defaults.go         — embeds tray-config.default.json
  locales.go          — embeds locales/*.json (loaded by internal/i18n)
scripts/
  build.sh            — build wrapper for Linux/macOS/WSL hosts
  build.ps1           — build wrapper for native Windows hosts (no `make` needed)
.github/
  workflows/ci.yml      — golangci-lint + build matrix (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest)
  workflows/release.yml — on `v*` tag push: builds and publishes a GitHub Release
  dependabot.yml         — weekly gomod + github-actions update PRs
```

## Key decisions and constraints

**Single instance**: named kernel mutex `Global\SingBoxTray`. On UAC re-launch, the existing process must call `CloseHandle` on the mutex _before_ `os.Exit(0)` — `os.Exit` skips defers. The `releaseMutex` func is passed from `main` → `tray.NewApp`.

**Tray icons**: `getlantern/systray` on Windows calls `LoadImage(LR_LOADFROMFILE, IMAGE_ICON)`. PNG bytes are silently ignored. Icons must be ICO format — `assets/icons/{idling,working,error}.ico` are real multi-resolution (16/32/48/256) artwork, embedded via `go:embed` in `assets/icons.go`.

**lxn/walk windows**: require `runtime.LockOSThread()` on the goroutine that creates them, and a Windows manifest with Common Controls v6 (`rsrc.syso`). Without the manifest the window creation fails silently.

**Window icons**: Settings/Log/About windows showed no icon in the taskbar/title bar. Root cause: `lxn/walk`'s window-class registration (`MustRegisterWindowClassWithWndProcPtrAndStyle` in the vendored library) does `LoadIcon(hInst, MAKEINTRESOURCE(7))` as its class-icon fallback — a convention from an older `rsrc` default — but this project's `rsrc.syso` assigns resource IDs in embed order (manifest gets 1, then the icon group gets 2), so ID 7 never resolves and Windows silently falls back to the generic system icon for every `lxn/walk` window. Fix: `internal/appicon` (`Icon() *walk.Icon`) explicitly sets each window's `Icon` property (`MainWindow{Icon: ...}`), which drives `WM_SETICON` directly instead of relying on the class default. `walk.NewIconFromFile` re-reads from disk per DPI, so it can't take embedded `[]byte` directly — `appicon.Icon()` writes `assets.IconGrey` to a fixed path in `os.TempDir()` once (`sync.Once`) and loads from there; the resulting `*walk.Icon` is shared across all three windows. Callers assign into a `var winIcon walk.Image` (interface-typed) guarded by `if ic := appicon.Icon(); ic != nil`, not a bare `*walk.Icon`, to avoid passing a typed-nil pointer into the `Icon Property` field — `declarative.ImageFrom`'s `case nil:` only catches a true untyped nil interface, so a typed-nil `*walk.Icon` would fall through to `case Image` and could panic when methods are called on it.

**TUN mode**: requires elevation. When TUN is selected without admin rights, `RelaunchAsAdmin` spawns an elevated instance with `--force-mode=tun`. The non-elevated instance releases the mutex immediately then exits (no sleep).

**Per-mode inbound injection**: `prepareConfig` (`internal/tray/tray.go`) filters the user's sing-box `config.json` down to only the inbound type relevant to the selected mode, so a config that defines both a proxy and a TUN inbound doesn't run both at once. Both paths use the shared helpers in `internal/config/config.go` (`LoadRawSingBoxConfig`, `FilterInbounds`, `WriteRawSingBoxConfig`) to rewrite a temp file — the original `config.json` is never modified. If a matching inbound already exists it's kept as-is; only if none is found is a default one built and appended.
- **TUN** (`internal/tun/tun.go`, `InjectTUN`): keeps only `tun`-type inbounds, appending a default one from `tray-config.json`'s `tun.*` fields if none exists. Also injects `route.auto_detect_interface: true` (required — without it sing-box cannot build Windows routing table entries and TUN captures no browser traffic) and prepends `{ process_name: ["sing-box.exe"], outbound: "direct" }` as first route rule to break the TUN loop for sing-box's own connections.
- **System proxy** (`config.InjectSystemProxy`): keeps only `http`/`mixed`-type inbounds, appending a default `mixed` inbound from `tray-config.json`'s `system_proxy.*` fields if none exists.
- Both write the result to `os.TempDir()`; the temp file is deleted on stop/crash.

**Absolute paths**: Go 1.19+ refuses relative paths in `exec.Command`. All paths from `tray-config.json` are resolved to absolute at load time in `config.Load`.

**`schtasks.exe`**: all calls use `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` (`SysProcAttr{CreationFlags: 0x08000000}`) to prevent console flash on startup.

**Stop→Start race**: `pendingStart bool` in `App`. If `start()` is called while state is `StateStopping`, it sets the flag and returns; `stop()` checks the flag after completing and calls `start()`.

**Config directory + Config submenu**: `config_dir`/`selected_config` (replacing the old single `config_path`) let a folder hold multiple sing-box configs, switchable without touching Settings. `config.Load` migrates a legacy `config_path` (from a tray-config.json predating this change) into `config_dir`/`selected_config` on first load, so existing installs keep pointing at their real config instead of silently falling back to the exe directory. `config.ListConfigFiles` (`internal/config/config.go`) scans `config_dir` non-recursively for `*.json`, excluding `tray-config.json` itself (relevant since the default `config_dir` is `.`, the exe directory, where `tray-config.json` also lives). `a.buildConfigItems(parent, dir)` (`tray.go`) does the scan-and-populate: it logs `config dir %s: found %d config file(s): %v` unconditionally (not just on error) so a folder that unexpectedly yields zero files is diagnosable from the log instead of just showing up as a disabled menu, adds one checkable submenu item per file found, each running its own `for range item.ClickedCh` goroutine (`getlantern/systray`'s `AddSubMenuItemCheckbox`/`ClickedCh` are documented safe to use from any goroutine — this is unlike every other submenu in the tray (Mode, Updates, Languages), which are fixed-size and folded into the single `select` in `handleClicks`; Config can't be, since the item count depends on what's in the folder), and enables/disables the parent item based on whether anything was found. `OnReady` calls it once for the startup scan; `rebuildConfigMenu` (called from `openSettings` when `ConfigDir` changed) calls it again against the new folder — old items are `Hide()`-den first since `getlantern/systray` has no item-removal API, then a fresh set is built and re-enables the parent if the new folder has files (undoing a previous disable). Clicking a config entry calls `switchConfig`, which mirrors `switchMode`: persists the choice, restarts sing-box live if it was running, and restarts the config-file watcher (`restartConfigWatcher`, replacing the old fixed `watchConfigFiles`) so it tracks the newly active file instead of the old one. The Settings window's config picker (a `ComboBox`, see `internal/settings/settings.go`) is intentionally fed the *same* `configNames` slice the tray submenu was last built from (passed into `settings.Show`), rather than re-scanning the disk itself, so the two can never disagree about what's available *at the moment Settings was opened* — picking a different folder in Settings only takes effect (both for the dropdown's own list and the tray submenu) after Save, via `rebuildConfigMenu`. `config.ListConfigFiles` matches `*.json` and excludes `tray-config.json` case-insensitively (`strings.EqualFold`), since Windows filesystems are case-insensitive and a mixed-case extension or filename would otherwise silently fall through the scan. The folder itself is also live-watched: `restartConfigDirWatcher` (started from `OnReady`, restarted alongside `restartConfigWatcher` whenever `ConfigDir` changes in Settings) wraps a `watcher.DirWatcher` (`internal/watcher/watcher.go`) that polls `config.ListConfigFiles(dir)` every 2s and calls `rebuildConfigMenu` when the returned name list differs from the previous poll — so dropping a new `*.json` file into `config_dir` (or removing one) updates the tray submenu without needing a tray restart or a trip through Settings. `DirWatcher` diffs sorted name slices rather than mtimes, unlike the plain `Watcher` it lives alongside, which is why it's a separate type in the same file instead of a mode of the existing one.
- **Gotcha**: `settings.configIndex` must return `-1`, not `0`, when the scanned config list is empty. `lxn/walk`'s declarative `ComboBox{CurrentIndex: 0}` on a model with zero items makes `walk.ComboBox.SetCurrentIndex(0)` fail (Win32 `CB_SETCURSEL` on an empty combo can't select index 0), which fails the whole `MainWindow{}.Create()` call — and `runWindow` swallows that error silently (just `return`s), so the entire Settings window fails to open with no error shown. `-1` is always valid (it means "no selection").

**sing-box auto-updater** (`internal/updater/updater.go`, orchestrated by `tray.go`'s `checkSingBoxUpdate`/`installSingBoxUpdate`): `updater.FetchLatest(owner, repo, channel)` hits `GET /repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases?per_page=10` (no auth, requires a `User-Agent` header) and is shared with the launcher self-updater below. Channel selection scans that list rather than using `/releases/latest`: `alpha` takes the first non-draft entry, `stable` takes the first non-draft, non-prerelease entry — this also lets `stable` correctly skip past newer alphas. The Windows asset is matched by exact suffix `-windows-amd64.zip`, which naturally excludes the `-legacy-windows-7.zip` variant (different suffix). The zip's contents are nested one level down (e.g. `sing-box-1.13.14-windows-amd64/{sing-box.exe, libcronet.dll, LICENSE}`); extraction strips whatever that single top-level directory is named (not hardcoded) and copies everything inside it — `libcronet.dll` is a runtime dependency of `sing-box.exe`, not just packaging. Installs go into `<exeDir>/sing-box/<tag>/`, tray.go points `sing_box_path` at the new copy and prunes sibling version directories. There is no `installed_version` config field — `updater.InstalledVersion` derives the current version by checking whether `sing_box_path` matches `<managedRoot>/<tag>/sing-box.exe`, so it can't go stale if the user hand-edits the path. The startup check (`OnReady`) pushes a toast unless `cfg.Update.AutoUpdate` is set, in which case it installs (and restarts sing-box if running) silently, no prompt; the interactive "Check for Updates" menu path always confirms via a Yes/No dialog first regardless of the auto-update setting. Switching the stable/pre-release channel (`toggleSingBoxPrerelease`, or the equivalent checkbox in Settings) immediately runs the same interactive check — a channel switch is exactly the situation where a different release is expected to be available, so it's checked right away instead of waiting for the next startup or manual "Check for Updates" click.

**Tray launcher self-updater** (`internal/selfupdate/selfupdate.go` + `internal/version/version.go`, orchestrated by `tray.go`'s `checkLauncherUpdate`/`installLauncherUpdate`): targets the repo the code actually lives in on GitHub — `soksanichenko/sing-box-tray-runner` per `git remote -v`, **not** the Go module path (`github.com/zelgray/sing-box-tray`), which is just an import-path choice. The release asset is the raw exe `release.yml` uploads (`sing_box_tray_runner.exe`, matched exactly via `updater.AssetNamed`, no zip). Current version comes from `version.Version`, a build-time `-X` override (`"dev"` for any build that didn't set it, e.g. local dev builds — always looks "outdated" against a real release, same as sing-box's fresh-install case). Mechanics, in order: download the new exe to `<exeDir>/sing_box_tray_runner.exe.new` — **same directory as the running exe, not `os.TempDir()`**, because `os.Rename`/`MoveFileW` on Windows can't cross drives; stop sing-box first if it's running (a child process isn't tied to the parent's lifetime here, so it would otherwise be silently orphaned once this process exits); `selfupdate.Apply` renames the running exe to `<exe>.old` (Windows permits renaming a mapped/executing image, just not deleting it) and moves the `.new` file into its place; spawn the new exe, then `releaseMutex()` + `os.Exit(0)` — the same spawn-before-release sequence the existing UAC elevation relaunch in `start()` already uses, reused rather than inventing a different handoff. `main.go` calls `selfupdate.CleanupOld(exePath)` once at startup to remove a leftover `.old` from a previous update. The startup check only auto-installs when `cfg.LauncherUpdate.AutoUpdate` is set; otherwise toast-only. There's no pre-release channel for the launcher (unlike sing-box) — always the latest stable release.

**First-run dependency check** (`tray.go`'s `checkFirstRunDeps`, called synchronously in `OnReady` before `start_on_launch` is honored): on every startup, `os.Stat`s `cfg.SingBoxPath` and `cfg.WintunDllPath`; either being missing triggers a Yes/No dialog offering to download it — this only ever fires in practice on a fresh install (or if the user deleted the file), since both checks are no-ops once the files exist. Missing sing-box.exe reuses the existing updater path (`updater.FetchLatest` + `installSingBoxUpdate(rel, true)`) rather than duplicating the download/extract logic. wintun.dll has no GitHub-releases equivalent, so `updater.DownloadWintunDll` hits a **hardcoded** `wintun.net` zip URL pinned to a specific version (`wintunDownloadURL`/`wintunZipDllEntry` in `internal/updater/updater.go`) — wintun.net has no "latest" alias, but the DLL itself hasn't changed since 2021, so pinning is low-maintenance; bump the version string by hand if wintun.net ever ships a new one. The zip's internal layout is `wintun/bin/<arch>/wintun.dll` (verified by inspecting the archive); only the amd64 entry is extracted, matching this project's Windows/amd64-only scope.

**Linting** (`.golangci.yml`): CI runs `golangci-lint` with `GOOS=windows` (the whole codebase is behind `//go:build windows`, so without it nothing gets analyzed). `errcheck` excludes ignoring the error from `Close()`/`Call()` on file handles, registry keys, `*walk.FormBase`, and Win32 `LazyProc` calls — established convention throughout this codebase, not something to "fix" file-by-file. `staticcheck`'s `ST1001` (no dot-imports) is disabled because `. "github.com/lxn/walk/declarative"` is that library's intended usage; `ST1000` (package doc comments) is disabled because it isn't this project's convention.

**About menu item**: `showAbout` (`tray.go`) gathers `version.Version` (this tray build), `updater.InstalledVersion(a.cfg.SingBoxPath, a.managedSingBoxRoot())` (empty/"unknown" unless `sing_box_path` currently points into the tray-managed `sing-box/<tag>/` folder — same derivation the updater itself uses), and a repo URL built from the `launcherOwner`/`launcherRepo` constants already used by the self-updater, so the two never drift apart. Displayed via `internal/aboutwin`, a small `lxn/walk` window (same `MainWindow`/singleton-instance pattern as `logwin`/`settings`) rather than `infoBox`, since a plain `MessageBoxW` can't contain a clickable link: the repo URL is a `walk.LinkLabel` (Win32 SysLink, `Text: <a href="...">...</a>`) whose `OnLinkActivated` opens it via `ShellExecuteW` (the same call `internal/elevation` uses for the UAC "runas" relaunch, just with the `"open"` verb instead of `"runas"`).

**Autostart backend** (`internal/autostart/autostart.go`): `Enable(elevated bool)` picks between two mechanisms depending on whether the current proxy mode needs admin rights. Non-elevated autostart writes an `HKCU\...\Run` value (`registry.CURRENT_USER`, same package `internal/proxy` already uses for the system-proxy registry keys) — a standard user always has write access to their own HKCU hive, so this can't hit the "Access is denied" failure `schtasks /Create` can produce in locked-down environments (group policy or EDR software restricting Task Scheduler, observed in the wild even for a user creating their own non-elevated task). Elevated autostart (TUN default mode) still goes through Task Scheduler with `/RL HIGHEST`, since that's the only mechanism that can launch with an administrator token at logon without popping an interactive UAC prompt — `HKCU\Run` always launches at the user's normal integrity level, so switching TUN autostart to it would trade the silent elevation for a UAC prompt on every login. `Enable` opportunistically removes whichever mechanism it's *not* using (only if that one is actually present) so toggling between elevated and non-elevated autostart never leaves two autostart entries launching the app twice; `IsEnabled`/`Disable` check and act on both mechanisms so neither can go unnoticed or unremoved.

**Autostart toggle** (`tray.go`): `toggleAutostart` is the single source of truth for actually calling into `autostart.Enable`/`Disable` and syncing `a.items.autostart`'s checkbox + `cfg.Autostart`; it always acts on whatever `autostart.IsEnabled()` currently reports, never on a passed-in target state, and surfaces a failed call via `infoBox` (not just a log line, which would leave a silently-stuck checkbox with no explanation). Both the tray menu checkbox (checked at `OnReady` from `autostart.IsEnabled()`, since `cfg.Autostart` is a write-only mirror that can go stale) and the Settings checkbox call into this same function rather than duplicating the enable/disable logic: `openSettings` captures `prevAutostart := autostart.IsEnabled()` before showing the dialog, passes it into `settings.Show` so the checkbox reflects real state, and in the save callback calls `a.toggleAutostart()` exactly once if `updated.Autostart != prevAutostart` (the Settings dialog itself only stores the checkbox value into `cfg.Autostart`, a plain struct field with no side effects, since `internal/settings` has no access to autostart or TUN-elevation state). After that call, the callback overwrites `updated.Autostart` with a fresh `autostart.IsEnabled()` read and syncs `a.items.autostart` from it via `checkOrUncheck` before saving — this is deliberate rather than trusting the checkbox's requested value, so a failed enable/disable can't leave `tray-config.json` claiming a state that was never actually applied.

**Localization** (`internal/i18n/i18n.go`): `Strings` covers every UI-facing string (tray menu, tooltips, toast/dialog text, Settings/Log window chrome), embedded per-language as `assets/locales/{en,ru,ua}.json` and loaded at `init()`. `tray-config.json`'s `language` field is resolved at `main.go` startup (`i18n.Resolve`, falling back to `i18n.Detect()` which reads `GetUserDefaultUILanguage` via kernel32) and passed into `tray.NewApp`. The tray **Languages** submenu and the Settings language dropdown both switch it live (no restart) via `App.applyLanguage`, which recomputes `a.strs` and calls `refreshMenuTexts()` — this relies on `getlantern/systray`'s `(*MenuItem).SetTitle`/`SetTooltip` (confirmed present in the vendored source), so every menu item whose text is translated must be stored on `App.items` even if never clicked (e.g. the "Mode"/"Updates" submenu parents), specifically so it can be retitled later. Proper nouns (`sing-box-tray`, `sing-box`) and the language names/picker label itself are literal constants, never routed through `Strings` — a language picker translated into a language the user doesn't want is unfindable. Per the user's global logging convention, `a.log(...)` calls are deliberately **not** localized and stay in English always; only `i18n` covers the interactive UI.
